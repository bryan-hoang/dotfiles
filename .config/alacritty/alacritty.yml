# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
import:

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.

  # Avoid nested SHLVL of 2. Not sure of the cause in different behaviour from
  # Wezterm.
  SHLVL: '0'
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  # TERM: alacritty
