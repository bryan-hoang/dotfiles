location

# (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also
# be set with the -H, --header flag of course. When used with -L, --loca‐tion
# you can append ";auto" to the -e, --referer URL to make curl automati‐cally
# set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto" string
# can be used alone, even if you do not set an initial -e, --referer.
