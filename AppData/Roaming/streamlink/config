# Use best or worst for selecting the highest or lowest available quality.
#
# Fallback streams can be specified by using a comma-separated list:
#
# "720p,480p,best"
#
# This is an alternative to setting the stream using a positional argument and
# can be useful if set in a config file.

# By default, Streamlink will close the player when the stream is over.
# Use this option to let the player stay or close itself instead.

hls-segment-threads=1

# Retry fetching the list of available streams until streams are found while
# waiting DELAY second(s) between each attempt. If unset, only one attempt will
# be made to fetch the list of streams available.
retry-streams=1

# Enables low latency streaming by prefetching HLS segments. Sets
# --hls-live-edge to 2, if it is higher. Reducing it to 1 will result in the
# lowest latency possible, but will most likely cause buffering.
#
# In order to achieve true low latency streaming during playback, the player's
# caching/buffering settings will need to be adjusted and reduced to a value as
# low as possible, but still high enough to not cause any buffering. This
# depends on the stream's bitrate and the quality of the connection to Twitch's
# servers. Please refer to the player's own documentation for the required
# configuration. Player parameters can be set via --player-args.
twitch-low-latency

# Skip embedded advertisement segments at the beginning or during a stream.
# Will cause these segments to be missing from the stream.
