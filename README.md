# Bryan's dotfiles

A [bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)
storing personal dotfiles.

## Installation

Running [`.local/bin/install-dotfiles`](.local/bin/install-dotfiles) is the
usual way of installing all the dot files. Otherwise, manually running the steps
in the `clone_repo` function also does the trick.

## Neovim

[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) provides the base configuration.
